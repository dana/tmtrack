Initial gemini prompt to create project that has a working tox test environment.

<background_context>

We are making a modern python, standards and PEP compliant flask based REST API that will connect to a localhost installed mongodb database.  This application is called "tmtrack", which means "time tracker".  Each mongodb document should represent a single task on a single day.  The mongodb document should contain at a minimum the following attributes:

* task_id : a required string that contains a synthetic UUID created upon document creation
* userid : a required string that contains the userid of the person doing the task
* date : the required calendar date on which the task is to be done
* task_name : a required string that is the name of the task
* category : a required string that is the category of the task
* expected_hours : a required float containing the number of hours the task is expected to take
* actual_hours : an optional float containing the number of hours the task actually took
* description : an optional large string that contains text allowing the user to add some context about this task

The unique, primary key for each document is task_id.

The initial REST API Flask calls are:

* Create a new task document that creates the previously a document with the previously defined attributes.  It will fail if any of the required attributes are missing, and also allow any optional attributes to be set at the same time.  It will allow any arbitrary additional attributes to be passed in by name and value, all of type string.  It will check all of the defined data types and fail if any of them are incorrect.  Prior to creating the document, create a string task_id that is also saved in the document and also returned by the REST API to the caller.

* Modify an existing task document.  This API call takes any number of arguments, but task_id is required and defines which document in the database is to be modified.  All of the other attributes passed into this API call over-write the values of the same named attributes in the mongodb document referenced by task_id.  The attributes should be type checked and the call should fail making no modifications if there are any errors, type checked or otherwise.

<create_project>

Please create this project as described above, including all of the necessary directory structure, configuration and support files.

Given all of this context, please select an appropriate mongodb database name and mongodb collection name for this project.

This should be fully testable by the 'tox' python framework.

Each API call should be testable and tested by command-line curl calls.

This is being built on Ubuntu 24.  Make sure what you produce passes all tests after a command-line 'tox' invocation.

This project will be hosted on github, please include all standard support and documentation files appropriate for a new github, modern python project.

</create_project>

Ran the above background and create project prompts together, worked pretty well:
https://github.com/dana/tmtrack/commit/7dd8f6f598a7536f42bf85422fc1e1d4ce3e39c3

'tox' works.  I wanted the tests to actually hit a real mongodb database instead of mock objects.

Second Gemini prompt.

<move_to_live_db_testing>
Our goal is to modify the above specified project such that the tests aren't mocked and run against a real, live, running mongodb database reachable on localhost on the standard port.

Please also modify the documentation detailing not only how to run the app on ubuntu 24 but also what command line steps are required to prepare the environment to run the app with standard 'flask run'.

</move_to_live_db_testing>

This is pretty good.  Tox still works, but there is an error when running it live.

I also changed the AI model from the default 'Nano Banana' to 'Gemini 2.5 Pro'

<fix_arbitrary_attribute_create_error>
Given the following command-line invocation, an error occurs:

$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "userid": "curluser1",
    "date": "2023-10-27",
    "task_name": "Review documentation",
    "category": "Documentation",
    "expected_hours": 2.0,
    "description": "Review the updated README.md"
}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/tasks
{"message":"Arbitrary attribute 'created_at' must be a string.","status":"error"}

Please make a test case to capture this error and also necessary code changes to fix it.

<fix_modify_error>
Given the following command-line invocation, an error occurs:

$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "actual_hours": 2.5,
    "notes": "Completed faster than expected."
}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/tasks/c5845f36-c22a-499f-8c69-520545df75ce
{"errors":{"task_id":"'task_id' is required for modification."},"message":"Validation failed","status":"error"}

Please make a test case to capture this error and also make necessary code changes to fix it.  Note that it should not be required to pass "task_id" in as an attribute since it's already defined in the URL.
</fix_modify_error>

<fix-jquery-cors-runtime-error>
The following javascript error occured:

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1/tasks' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

What code changes are necessary to resolve this?

<multi-users-pt1>
Add a new REST route called list_users that returns an array of strings.
Each of these strings are a userid that is allowed to use this system.
The two userids to return are: "dana" and "michelle".

Please add a test for this route in the normal way.
